Hi, I’m Markus Gulla 👋

I’m a Computer Engineering student at Salt Lake Community College, planning to transfer to the University of Utah with a focus on software, embedded systems, and data engineering.

💻 What I work on:

- Building systems-level software (C-based text editor, Java game engine).

- Developing embedded projects with Arduino and Raspberry Pi (sensor integration, circuit design).

- Exploring data analysis & wrangling using Python (Pandas) and MATLAB.

⚡ Industry experience:

- Former Micron Technology intern, where I diagnosed semiconductor equipment, analyzed historical datasets, and monitored real-time sensor systems.

🌱 Currently learning:

- Data wrangling with Pandas for processing, cleaning, and aggregating datasets.

- Expanding software skills into backend systems and algorithms.

🤝 What I value:
Collaboration, problem-solving, and bringing technical solutions to real-world challenges — whether in software, embedded systems, or data-driven engineering.
