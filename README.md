Hi, my name is Markus!
I'm a computer engineering student with a growing interest in embedded systems. I enjoy learning how hardware and software work together to create efficient, real-world systems. Right now, I'm focused on building a strong foundation in engineering and math to better understand how to design and optimize these systems.
