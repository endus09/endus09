Hi my name is Markus!
I am a dedicated computer engineering student with a strong interest in advancing the capabilities of virtual and augmented reality systems, particularly through haptic feedback and brain-computer interfaces. Currently, I am focused on mastering the core principles and scientific foundations of engineering to achieve these goals.
